<h1> QuADex: Civil Engineering Qualifying and Diagnostic Examination for St. Anthony’s College – Antique </h1>

<p> The website is designed to help both the administrator and the students, thus there are two unique platforms for each user. The admin will have unique username and password that will add security to the account that is assigned to the admin where the admin will have the authority to create exams and to manage the accounts of the students that are registered to a specific examination. The website will provide counter measures which provide strict security systems for student accounts to avoid the cheating. This will provide precise results that are based on the answers of the students.</p>
